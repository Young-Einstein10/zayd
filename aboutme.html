	<p>
	 		I'm a web designer, computer repairman, and a potential metal fabricator. I'm currently at Yaba College of Technology studying Welding and Fabrication Engineering and observing a training on Web Design. I worked with Joeycash Engineering Limited as an Intern during which I learnt the basic rudiments of Enginneering as a whole. I'm really passionate about Computer Programming and would love to learn new things about this amazing new field of mine.

  	<p>
		I'm 18, dark in complexion and about 5ft tall. I live at barracks which is located within the vicinity of Surulere. I'm the first child of my parents and i've got four other siblings after me. I'm interested in computer programming, religion, games and engineering at whole. Computer programming first occurred to me when I discovered they were used in making most of the games which I was used to playing, since then, I've made up my mind to add programming into one of the things I need to learn before age 22.
