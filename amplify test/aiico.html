                            With easy access to Broadband and DSL the number of people using the Internet has skyrocket in recent years. E-mail, instant messaging and file sharing with other inetrnet users has also provided a platform for faster spreading of viruses,Trojans and Spyware. Being on the internet without porper protection is like walking in the rain with no umbrella-you're gonna get wet no matter how fast you run. With so many computers installed in home offices it becomes critical that home users install the latest Microsoft patches when they become available.
